PARENTAL INVOLVEMENTINTRODUCTIONThe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB Act) reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), and is based on four principles that provide a framework through which families, educators, and communities can work together to improve teaching and learning.  These principles are accountability for results, local control and flexibility, expanded parental choice, and effective and successful programs that reflect scientifically based research.  The parental involvement provisions in Title I, Part A of the ESEA reflect these principles.  Specifically, these provisions stress shared accountability between schools and parents for high student achievement, including expanded public school choice and supplemental educational services for eligible children in low-performing schools, local development of parental involvement plans with sufficient flexibility to address local needs, and building parents’ capacity for using effective practices to improve their own children’s academic achievement.  New reporting provisions added by the NCLB Act offer parents important insight into their children’s education, the professional qualifications of their teachers, and the quality of the schools they attend.  The new legislation ensures that parents have the information they need to make well-informed choices for their children, more effectively share responsibility with their children’s schools, and help those schools develop effective and successful academic programs.  Parents now will know their children’s academic strengths and weaknesses and how well schools are performing, and they will have other options and resources for helping their children if their schools are identified in need of improvement. The new Title I, Part A is designed not only to help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged and minority students and their peers, but also to change the culture of America’s schools so that success is defined in terms of student achievement and schools invest in every child.1  As indicated by the parental involvement provisions in Title I, Part A, the involvement of parents in their children’s education and schools is critical to that process.  Secretary Paige put it succinctly when he stated, “[s]chools can’t improve without the help of parents.”2 Three decades of research provide convincing evidence that parents are an important influence in helping their children achieve high academic standards. When schools collaborate with parents to help their children learn and when parents participate in school activities and decision-making about their children’s education, children achieve at higher levels.  In short, when parents are involved in education, children do better in school and schools improve.3This guidance is divided into five major sections.  The first deals with general issues related to parental involvement, the second addresses the parental involvement responsibilities of State educational agencies (SEAs), the third describes responsibilities of local educational agencies (LEAs), the fourth describes the responsibilities of schools, and the fifth describes the responsibilities of LEAs and schools to build parents’ capacity for becoming involved in improving their child’s academic achievement.  Included in the appendices are relevant definitions (Appendix A), key Title I, Part A parental notice requirements (Appendix B), a list of research-based resources for improving teaching and learning (Appendix C), a sample template that might be used for the development of a district-wide parental involvement policy (Appendix D), and a sample template for a school-parent compact (Appendix E).PURPOSEThe purpose of this guidance is to assist SEAs, LEAs, and schools in administering the parental involvement provisions of Title I, Part A of the ESEA. This guidance is not intended to be all-inclusive; rather, it answers questions about and clarifies aspects of the law that have been brought to the attention of the U.S. Department of Education (ED).  This guidance may be supplemented in the future as other issues arise.  The questions are primarily based on issues raised by State and local school officials and staff, education leaders, technical assistance providers, parents, parent advocacy organizations, parental involvement coordinators/liaisons, and others who are actively engaged in working with parents to improve student achievement and learning.
A.	GENERAL INFORMATIONA-1.	What is parental involvement under No Child Left Behind?Parental involvement always has been a centerpiece of Title I.  However, for the first time in the history of the ESEA, it has a specific statutory definition. The statute defines parental involvement as the participation of parents in regular, two-way, and meaningful communication involving student academic learning and other school activities, including ensuring—• that parents play an integral role in assisting their child’s learning;• that parents are encouraged to be actively involved in their child’s education at school;• that parents are full partners in their child’s education and are included, as appropriate, in decision-making and on advisory committees to assist in the education of their child; and• that other activities are carried out, such as those described in section 1118 of the ESEA (Parental Involvement). [Section 9101(32), ESEA.]A-2.	What is the significance of the statutory definition?The definition of parental involvement sets the parameters, in conjunction with other sections of the law by which SEAs, LEAs and schools will implement programs, activities, and procedures to involve parents in Title I, Part A programs.A-3.	Who is a parent for the purposes of Title I, Part A?The term “parent” includes in addition to a natural parent, a legal guardian or other person standing in loco parentis (such as a grandparent or stepparent with whom the child lives, or a person who is legally responsible for the child’s welfare). [Section 9101(31), ESEA.]A-4.	Why is parental involvement important?A synthesis of the research concluded that “the evidence is consistent, positive, and convincing: families have a major influence on their children’s achievement in school and through life. When schools, families, and community groups work together to support learning, children tend to do better in school, stay in school longer, and like school more.”4A-5.	What does the research show about how family involvement in children’s education affects student achievement?Studies have found that students with involved parents, no matter what their income or background, are more likely to—• Earn high grades and test scores, and enroll in higher-level programs;• Pass their classes, earn credits, and be promoted; • Attend school regularly; and• Graduate and go on to postsecondary education.5A-6.	What are the key Title I, Part A parental notice requirements?The key parental notice requirements for SEAs, LEAs, and schools are set forth in Appendix B to this guidance. A-7.	What are the parental involvement provisions in section 1118 of the ESEA?Title I, Part A provides for substantive parental involvement at every level of the program, such as in the development and implementation of the State and local plan, and in carrying out the LEA and school improvement provisions.  Section 1118 contains the primary Title I, Part A requirements for SEAs, LEAs, and schools related to involving parents in their children’s education.  It is this section that identifies critical points in the process of improving teaching and learning where parents and the community can intervene and assist in school improvement.  Although section 1118 is extensive in scope and has many requirements for LEAs and schools, the intent is not to be burdensome.  These provisions reflect good practice in engaging families in helping to educate their children, because students do better when parents are actively involved in the education process, both at home and at school.  A-8.	How must SEAs, LEAs, and schools communicate with parents in general?Because regular communication is the foundation of effective parental involvement, SEAs, LEAs, and schools must provide information to parents of students participating in Title I, Part A programs in an understandable and uniform format, including alternative formats upon request, and, “to the extent practicable,” in a language that parents can understand.  (See, for example, a State’s notification to parents of LEA improvement status (section 1116(c)(6)), a school’s notification to parents of the written parental involvement policy (section 1118(b)(1)), and LEA and school notifications to parents of information related to parent programs, meetings, and other activities (section 1118(e)(5).) [Title I, Part A Final Regulations, 34 CFR Section 200.36 (“Title I Regulations”)  A-9.	What is meant by providing information to parents with limited English proficiency, “to the extent practicable,” in a language parents can understand?This means that, whenever practicable, written translations of printed information must be provided to parents with limited English proficiency in a language they understand.  However, if written translations are not practicable, it is practicable to provide information to limited English proficient parents orally in a language that they understand.   SEAs and LEAs have flexibility in determining what mix of oral and written translation services may be necessary and reasonable for communicating the required information to parents with limited English proficiency.  [Title I, Part A Final Regulations, 67 Fed. Reg. 71749 – 50, Comments and Discussion on Section 200.36; available at ED’s website at http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2002-4/120202a.html.]  This requirement is consistent with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), as amended, and its implementing regulations.  Under those regulations, recipients of Federal financial assistance have a responsibility to ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by persons with limited English proficiency.  It is also consistent with ED policy under Title VI and Executive Order 13166 (Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency).  The Department of Justice’s Guidance on Title VI and E.O. 13166, which provides clarification on how to determine an appropriate mix of language services, may be found in the Federal Register, 67 Fed. Reg. 41455-41472 (June 18, 2002), or online at http://www.lep.gov. A-10.	How must an SEA, LEA, or school communicate with parents with disabilities to ensure meaningful participation in Title I, Part A programs?SEAs, LEAs, and schools must take the necessary steps to ensure that communications with parents with disabilities are as effective as communications with other parents.  Those steps include that SEAs, LEAs, and schools must furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services when necessary to afford a parent with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, Title I, Part A programs, services, and activities, including the parental involvement provisions.   SEAs, LEAs, and schools must provide an opportunity to parents with disabilities to request the auxiliary aids and services of their choice (such as sign language interpreters and large print or materials in Braille) to ensure meaningful participation in the different types of programs or activities carried out to implement the Part A provisions.  The SEA, LEA, or school must give primary consideration to the expressed choice of a parent with disabilities by honoring that choice, unless the SEA, LEA, or school can demonstrate that another effective means of communication exists, or that use of the means chosen by the parent would result in a fundamental alteration in the service, program, or activity or in an undue financial and administrative burden.  [28 CFR Sections 35.104 and 35.160-164, and Appendix A to Part 35 of Title 28T of the Code of Federal Regulations implementing subtitle A of title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990)] A-11.	What Federal civil rights provisions are applicable to parental involvement activities?In implementing parental involvement programs, activities, and procedures, States, LEAs and schools may not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age, consistent with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975.A-12.	May an SEA or LEA use funds from other Federal programs for activities related to parental involvement?A number of ESEA programs allow the use of funds for parental involvement activities.  Examples of such programs include Reading First, the Even Start Family Literacy Program, Comprehensive School Reform, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers. Subject to the rules and requirements of the program, those funds can be coordinated with the Title I, Part A funds that an SEA or LEA uses to meet its parental involvement responsibilities.  An SEA or LEA also may find the new transferability authority added by the NCLB useful in maximizing available funds for parental involvement activities under programs subject to that authority.  Subject to specific requirements, that authority allows SEAs and LEAs to transfer a certain amount of funds among some programs, such as into Title V, Part A (“Innovative Programs”) to address local educational needs and priorities. [For more detailed information, see the  Transferability Authority Non-Regulatory Guidance on line at http://www.ed.gov/programs/transferability/finalsummary04.doc.]A-13.	What are Parental Information and Resource Centers?Parental Information and Resource Centers, authorized by subpart 16 of Part D of Title V of the ESEA, are school-linked or school-based centers established by nonprofit organizations and consortia of nonprofit organizations and LEAs under competitive grants from ED.  These Parental Information and Resource Centers provide comprehensive training, information, and support to parents, individuals who work with parents, SEAs, LEAs, and other organizations that carry out parental education and family involvement programs.  In awarding grants under this program, the Department has given priority to centers that make parents aware of, and help them take advantage of, the public school choice and supplemental educational services provisions of Title I, Part A.  To contact a center see: pirc-info.net.   [Section 5561 – 5566, ESEA.]A-14.

What parental involvement provisions are included in State plans?SEAs must support the collection and dissemination of effective parental involvement practices to its LEAs and schools.  Those practices must be based on the most current research, meeting the highest professional and technical standards, on effective parental involvement that fosters achievement to high standards for all children.  In addition, those practices must be geared toward lowering barriers to greater participation by parents in school planning, review, and improvement experiences.  [Section 1111(d), ESEA.]  [See Appendix C for a sample of research-based resources on parental involvement.]In addition, each SEA must assure that it will provide technical assistance that is designed to improve teaching and learning to LEAs and schools including technical assistance relating to parental involvement under section 1118.  [Section 1111(c)(4), ESEA.]B-2.	Must an SEA consult with parents in the development of the State plan?Yes.  An SEA must consult with parents, along with others, such as LEAs, in developing its State plan. [Section 1111(a)(1), ESEA.]B-3.	What responsibility does an SEA have with respect to the parental involvement provisions in local plans?An SEA must review each LEA’s plan to determine if the LEA’s parental involvement activities meet the requirements of section 1118.  [Section 1112(e)(3), ESEA.]B-4.	May an SEA use the Title I, Part A funds it reserves for State administration to meet its parental involvement responsibilities?Yes, this is permitted.  [Section 1004, ESEA.]Information Dissemination and Technical AssistanceB-5.	What information about LEA and school performance must an SEA disseminate to parents? State report cards must include information related to assessments, accountability, and teacher quality, and must include data from all LEAs in the State.  A description of each of the data elements (assessments, accountability, teacher quality) for State report cards is included in the Report Cards, Title I, Part A Non-Regulatory Guidance available at:  http://www.ed.gov/programs/titleiparta/reportcardsguidance.doc.]  The information in the report cards must be in an understandable and uniform format, including alternative formats upon request, and, “to the extent practicable,” in a language that parents understand. [Section 1111(h)(1)(B)(ii), ESEA.]B-6.	What information about individual student academic assessment must SEAs provide to parents?A central requirement of the NCLB Act is that SEAs, in consultation with LEAs, must implement a set of high-quality, yearly student academic assessments that include, at a minimum, academic assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and (beginning with school year 2007-08) science.  As a part of this assessment system, SEAs must produce individual student interpretive, descriptive, and diagnostic reports that allow parents, teachers, and principals to understand and address the specific academic needs of each student, and that include information regarding achievement on academic assessments aligned with each State’s academic achievement standards.  SEAs must provide these reports to parents, teachers, and principals of all public schools as soon as possible after the assessments are given.  The information must be provided to parents in an understandable and uniform format, including alternative formats upon request (see A-8 and A-10) and, to the extent practicable, in a language that parents can understand (see A-9 and A-10).  [Section 1111(b)(3)(C)(xii), ESEA.] Progress ReviewsB-7.	What are an SEA’s responsibilities for reviewing and disseminating information about the progress of an LEA’s parental involvement activities?  As a part of its annual yearly progress review of each LEA receiving Title I, Part A funds, the SEA must determine if each LEA is, among other things, carrying out its responsibilities under section 1118 with respect to parental involvement.  [Section 1116(c)(1)(A), ESEA.]The SEA must publicize and disseminate the results of this review to its LEAs, teachers and other staff, parents, students, and the community. [Section 1116(c)(1)(B), ESEA.]SEA Notification to Parents of Children in an LEA or School Identified for Improvement, Corrective Action, or RestructuringB-8.	How must an SEA, LEA or school communicate with parents during the school improvement process?Throughout the school improvement process, the appropriate entity--the SEA, LEA, or school--must communicate with the parents of each child attending a school identified for school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring in a manner consistent with the requirements described in A-8, A-9, and A-10.  The information must be provided to parents directly, by such means as regular mail or e-mail.  If the SEA does not have access to individual student addresses, it may provide the information to the LEAs or schools for distribution to parents.  The SEA, LEA, or school must also provide information to parents during the school improvement process by broader means of dissemination such as the Internet, media, or public agencies that serve the student population and their families.  All communications must respect the privacy of students and their families.  [Section 200.36 of the Title I Regulations and Section 1116, ESEA.]B-9.	What are an SEA’s responsibilities regarding notification to parents of children in an LEA identified for improvement or corrective action? An SEA must promptly notify the parents of each student enrolled in a school served by an LEA that the LEA has been identified for improvement or corrective action.  The notice must include information about:  the results of the SEA’s annual progress review of schools served by the LEA in meeting the State’s student academic achievement standards; whether the LEA is carrying out its responsibilities for sections 1116, 1117, 1118, and 1119; the reasons for the identification; and how parents can participate in upgrading the quality of the LEA.  [Section 1116 (c)(1) and (6), ESEA.]In the case of an LEA identified for corrective action, the SEA must publish and disseminate to parents and the public information on corrective actions taken by the SEA. [Section 1116(c)(10)(E), ESEA.]SEA Technical Assistance to an LEA or School in Need of ImprovementB-10.	What technical assistance related to parental involvement must an SEA provide for LEAs and schools in need of improvement?For each LEA that the SEA identifies for improvement, the SEA must provide technical or other assistance, if requested, to better enable the LEA to develop and implement the LEA’s plan and work with schools needing improvement.  This technical assistance must be provided by the SEA or an entity authorized by the SEA, and must be supported by effective methods and instructional strategies from scientifically based research (SBR).  This technical assistance must address problems, if any, in implementing the parental involvement activities in section 1118. [Section 1116(c)(9), ESEA.]C.	LEA RESPONSIBILITIESGeneralC-1.	Are the parental involvement provisions in section 1118 of the ESEA applicable to LEAs?Yes.  An LEA may receive funds under Title I, Part A only if the LEA implements programs, activities, and procedures for the involvement of parents in Title I, Part A programs that are consistent with the requirements of section 1118.  LEAs must plan and implement these programs, activities, and procedures with meaningful consultation with parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs.  [Section 1118(a), ESEA.]C-2. 	What is the basic parental involvement requirement under Title I, Part A for LEAs?Each LEA that receives Title I, Part A funds must develop a written parental involvement policy that establishes the LEA’s expectations for parental involvement.  The policy must be developed jointly with, and agreed upon with, the parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs and distributed to parents of all children participating in Title I, Part A programs.  [Section 1118(a)(2), ESEA.]If the LEA already has a district-level parental involvement policy that applies to all parents, the LEA may amend that existing policy, if necessary, to meet the requirements of section 1118.  [Section 1118(b)(3), ESEA.]C-3.	What specific information must an LEA’s written parental involvement policy contain?  An LEA’s written parental involvement policy must establish the LEA’s expectations for parental involvement, and describe how the LEA will—• Involve parents in jointly developing the LEA’s local plan under section 1112 and in the process of school review and improvement under section 1116;• Provide the coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary to assist Title I, Part A schools in planning and implementing effective parental involvement activities to improve student academic achievement and school performance;• Build the schools’ and parents’ capacity for strong parental involvement;• Coordinate and integrate parental involvement strategies under Title I, Part A with parental involvement strategies under other programs, such as Head Start, Reading First, Early Reading First, Even Start, Parents as Teachers, Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), State-run preschool programs, and Title III language instructional programs;• Conduct, with the involvement of parents, an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of the parental involvement policy in improving the academic quality of the schools served with Title I, Part A funds, including—o Identifying barriers to greater participation by parents in parental involvement activities, with particular attention to parents who are economically disadvantaged, are disabled, have limited English proficiency, have limited literacy, or are of any racial or ethnic minority background;o Using the findings of the evaluation to design strategies for more effective parental involvement; o Revising, if necessary, the LEA’s parental involvement policies; and • Involve parents in the activities of schools served under Title I, Part A.  [Section 1118(a)(2), ESEA.]  [For more detailed information see Appendix D for a sample template of a District wide Parental Involvement Policy.]C-4.	What is the relationship between the local plan an LEA submits to its SEA and the LEA’s written parental involvement policy?An LEA must incorporate its written parental involvement policy (developed in accordance with section 1118) into its local plan (developed under section 1112 of the ESEA), which is submitted to its SEA.  [Section 1118(a)(2), ESEA.]   If the LEA’s plan is not satisfactory to the parents of participating children, the LEA must submit any parent comments, along with the LEA’s plan, to the SEA. [Section 1118(b)(4), ESEA.]C-5.	What other information related to parents must an LEA include in its local plan under section 1112?An LEA must describe in its local plan (developed under section 1112 of the ESEA) how the LEA will coordinate its Title I, Part A program with programs under Title II of the ESEA to provide professional development to teachers and principals, and, if appropriate, to parents and other staff. [Section 1112(b)(1)(D), ESEA.]  C-6.	What information must LEAs provide parents about the teachers and paraprofessionals who work with their children?At the beginning of each school year, LEAs must inform parents of each student attending a Title I, Part A school of their right to request information about the professional qualifications of both the teachers and the paraprofessionals who teach and work with their children in an understandable and uniform format, including alternative formats upon request, and, “to the extent practicable,” in a language that parents understand. [See A-8, A-9 and A-10 for additional information on communicating with parents; Appendix B for a list of the key notification requirements; and for information on paraprofessionals in Title I, Part A programs, see the Title I Paraprofessionals Non-Regulatory Guidance at:  http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/paraguidance.pdf.]    (Section 1111(h)(6) and (C), ESEA, Sections 200.61 (a)(1) and (2) of the Title I Regulations.) C-7.	What information must LEAs provide to parents in the LEA report card about the performance of their child’s school to assist parents in making decisions about their children’s education?Similar to State report cards, LEA report cards must include information related to the data elements (assessment, accountability, and teacher quality) as it applies to the LEA as a whole and as it applies to each school served by the LEA.  Individual school report cards are not required, but information about each school must be included in the LEA report card.  Example charts with all the required assessment data elements at the LEA and school level are provided in Tables 4 and 5 of the Report Cards, Title I, Part A Non-Regulatory Guidance available at: http://www.ed.gov/programs/titleiparta/reportcardsguidance.doc.]  The information in the report cards must be in an understandable and uniform format, including alternative formats upon request, and, “to the extent practicable,” in a language that parents understand.  [Section 1111(h)(2) and (E), ESEA.] C-8.	What information must all LEAs receiving Title I, Part A funds provide to parents of limited English proficient students?LEAs receiving Title I, Part A funds must implement effective means of outreach to parents of limited English proficient students to inform those parents of how the parents –• can be involved in the education of their children; and• be active participants in assisting their children to attain English proficiency, achieve at high levels in core academic subjects, and meet the challenging State academic achievement standards and State academic content standards expected of all students.  LEAs’ outreach to parents of limited English proficient students must include sending notice of opportunities for, and holding, regular meetings for the purpose of formulating and responding to recommendations from parents of Title I, Part A students.  [Section 1112(g)(4), ESEA.]C-9.    What notice and information must LEAs with Title I, Part A-funded language instruction educational programs provide to parents of limited English proficient students?LEAs using Title I, Part A funds to provide a language instruction educational program (as defined in Part C of Title III of the ESEA) must provide the following information to a parent or parents of limited English proficient children identified for participation or participating in such a program:• the reasons for the identification of their child as limited English proficient and in need of placement in a language instruction educational program;• the child’s level of English proficiency, how that level was assessed, and the status of the child’s academic achievement;• the methods of instruction used in the program in which their child is, or will be participating, and the methods of instruction used in other available programs, including how those programs differ in content, instructional goals, and the use of English and a native language in instruction;• how the program in which their child is or will be participating will meet the educational strengths and needs of their child;• how the program will specifically help their child learn English, and meet age-appropriate academic achievement standards for grade promotion and graduation;• the specific exit requirements of the program, including the expected rate of transition from the program into classrooms that are not tailored for limited English proficient children, and the expected rate of graduation from secondary school for the program if Title I, Part A funds are used for children in secondary schools;• in the case of a child with a disability, how the program meets the objectives of the child’s individualized education program (IEP) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or the child’s individualized services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (section 504);• information pertaining to parental rights, including written guidance—o detailing the option that parents have a right to decline enrollment in a language instructional program and to choose  another program or method of instruction if available,o detailing the right that parents have to remove their child immediately from the program upon the parents’ request, ando assisting parents in selecting among various programs and methods of instruction, if more than one program or method is offered by the eligible entity. • These notice requirements also apply to a language instruction educational program funded under Part A of Title III. [Section 3303, ESEA.]• The notice and information provided must be in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, provided in a language that the parents can understand. [Section 1112(g)(2), ESEA]LEAs must provide the above information to parents not later than 30 days after the beginning of the school year for those children identified before the beginning of the school year as limited English proficient.  For children identified after the beginning of the school year as limited English proficient, LEAs must provide the above information to parents within the first 2 weeks of the child being placed in a language instruction educational program.In addition, if a language instruction educational program has not made progress on the annual measurable achievement objectives under section 3122 of the ESEA, the eligible entity using the Title I, Part A funds must provide separate notification to parents of a child identified for participation in, or participating in, that program to inform them of that failure not later than 30 days after the failure occurs.  [Section 1112(g)(1), (2), and (3), ESEA.] C-10.	What information must LEAs provide to parents of a child with a disability who is in a language instruction educational program?In the case of a child with a disability who is in a language instruction educational program, parents must be notified, not later than 30 days after the beginning of the school year, of how the language instruction educational program meets the objectives of the child’s IEP under the IDEA or the child’s individualized services under Section 504. [Section 1112(g)(1)(A)(i), ESEA.]C-11.	Do parents of private school children in Title I, Part A programs have the right to equitable participation in parental involvement activities?  Yes.  Under the equitable participation provisions of Title I, Part A, an LEA must provide eligible children enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools, on an equitable basis, special education services and other benefits under Title I, Part A, including parental involvement services and activities, that are comparable to the services and benefits provided to their public school counterparts.  The amount of funds available to provide equitable services from the applicable reserved funds must be proportionate to the number of private school children from low-income families residing in the participating public school attendance areas. As part of complying with this requirement, an LEA must provide equitable services to parents of private school participants from the funds set aside for this purpose.  Activities for the parents of private school participants must be planned and implemented after meaningful consultation with private school officials and parents and conducted either in conjunction with the LEA’s parental involvement activities or independently.  Activities that LEAs can provide parents that will assist private school students in achieving high academic standards include a written agreement between the LEA and parents of private school participants regarding the responsibilities of the LEA and parents in the Title I program, parent meetings, communication between the Title I teachers and parents on students’ academic progress, parent-teacher conferences, and parent education.  [Section 200.65(a)(2) of the Title I Regulations and Section 1120, ESEA.]C-12. 	What responsibilities do LEAs have to parents with respect to complaint procedures relating to violations of Title I, Part A requirements? SEAs must adopt written procedures, consistent with State law, for receiving and resolving any complaint from an organization or individual that the SEA, LEA or other agency, or consortium of agencies, is violating a Federal statute or regulation that applies to the Title I, Part A program, such as the school accountability or parental involvement provisions.  The SEA’s procedures must contain a requirement that LEAs disseminate, free of charge, adequate information about the complaint procedures to parents of students, and appropriate private school officials or representatives.  [General Provisions Regulations, at 34 CFR Sections 299.10 – 299.12.]LEA Funding for Parental Involvement C-13.	What funds must an LEA reserve for parental involvement activities under section 1118?  An LEA that receives a Title I, Part A allocation of greater than $500,000 must reserve not less than one percent of its Title I, Part A allocation to carry out the provisions of section 1118, including promoting family literacy and parenting skills. The percentage reserved for parental involvement must be calculated on the basis of the LEA’s total Title I, Part A allocation. [Section 1118(a)(3)(A), ESEA.]  C-14.	Do the parental involvement requirements of section 1118 apply to LEAs with a Title I, Part A allocation of $500,000 or less?Yes.  LEAs with a Title I, Part A allocation of $500,000 or less must carry out the provisions of section 1118, but are not required to reserve any specific amount from their Title I, Part A allocation to do so.  [Section 1118(a)(3), ESEA.] C-15.	How does an LEA determine the amount of funds to be used for parental involvement activities for parents of private school children participating in Title I, Part A activities?An LEA must reserve funds for parental involvement activities for parents of private school children who participate in Title I, Part A activities from the amount the LEA has reserved for parental involvement.  These funds must be reserved by the LEA before any allocation of funds to its respective school attendance areas and schools. The amount of funds reserved for these activities must be proportionate to the number of private school children from low-income families residing in participating public school attendance areas. [Sections 200.65 and 200.77 of the Title I Regulations.] EXAMPLE OF EQUITABLE SERVICES CALCULATION RELATED TO PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT FOR FAMILIES OF PRIVATE SCHOOL CHILDRENAn LEA reserves one and a half percent ($90,000) of its Title I allocation of $6,000,000 for parental involvement activities. (Note that this is more than the required minimum of one percent.)  The number of public and private school children from low-income families residing in participating Title I attendance areas is 25,000.  Five percent of the 25,000 children attend private schools; thus five percent of the $90,000 reservation, or $4,500, is available for parental involvement activities for parents of private school participants.  The parental involvement program funded by Title I must meet the needs of the parents of private school participants.  After consultation with the appropriate private school officials, the LEA may conduct these activities independently or in conjunction with the LEA’s regular parental involvement activities.C-16.	What amount of funds must an LEA allot to schools for parental involvement activities under section 1118?An LEA with an allocation in excess of $500,000 first must determine the percentage of its Title I allocation that it wishes to reserve for parental involvement activities under section 1118.  That percentage must be at least one percent of the LEA’s Title I allocation, and may be more.  The LEA then must set aside an amount for parental involvement of parents of private school children, based on the proportion of private school children from low-income families residing in Title I attendance areas, as explained in C-15 and the example following C-15.  The LEA then must distribute to its public schools at least 95 percent of the remainder, leaving the balance of the reserved funds for parental involvement activities at the LEA level.  [See C-17 for a discussion of how the LEA may allocate the funds among its public schools.] [Section 1118(a)(3)(C), ESEA.]EXAMPLE:  CALCULATION OF LEA’S DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO SCHOOLS FOR PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITIES:	LEA’s total Title I allocation					$6,000,000	Parental involvement reservation (1%) 	    (.01 x $6,000,000)	      					$ 60,000			 (.05 (percentage of private school children) Private school       set-aside for parents x $60,000 (amount LEA reserved           for parental involvement))					$       3,000      Amount remaining ($60,000 - $3,000)			$     57,000      Public school distribution (95% (required minimum               distribution percentage) x $57,000)	                         $     54,150          Balance available for LEA-level parental 	                        		                                                    involvement activities  ($57,000 - $54,150)		$       2,850		   . C-17.	On what basis may an LEA distribute to schools served under Title I, Part A, the funds it has reserved for schools to carry out the parental involvement provisions of section 1118?   In distributing the amount of funds the LEA reserves for schools to carry out the parental involvement provisions of section 1118, an LEA may use the same formula it uses to determine the per-pupil allocations for those schools or it may distribute those funds in another manner.  An LEA may use any one of or a combination of factors; for example, it may choose to allocate funds to schools in improvement status; base its allocation on the results of the LEA’s annual evaluation of parental involvement activities; or make use of the SEA’s annual adequate yearly progress review of how its LEAs are carrying out their responsibilities for activities under section 1118.   C-18.	What input do parents have in how an LEA allots to schools the funds the LEA has reserved for parental involvement?The LEA must involve parents of Title I, Part A participating children in decisions about how it allots to schools the funds the LEA has reserved for parental involvement activities.  The involvement of parents should be in a manner consistent with the definition of parental involvement (A-1).  In terms of process and representation, an LEA may choose to use its district-wide parent advisory council (if it has chosen to establish one) to provide advice on this and other matters relating to Title I, Part A programs. [Section 1118(a)(3)(B) and 1118(e)(12), ESEA.]C-19.	If an LEA reserves more than the required one percent of its Title I, Part A funds for parental involvement, must 95 percent of the entire amount reserved be distributed to schools served under Title I, Part A?  No.  The LEA may retain for district-wide parental involvement activities the full amount of any Title I, Part A funds reserved for that purpose in excess of the required one percent.  However, the requirement to allocate an equitable amount for the involvement of private school parents (as described in C-15) applies to the entire amount set-aside. [Section 1118(a)(3)(C), ESEA.]LEA Responsibilities for School ImprovementC-20.	In reviewing annually the progress of each school, what must an LEA communicate to parents, teachers, principals, schools, and the community?An LEA must publicize and disseminate the results of its local annual review of each school (i.e., the review used to determine whether the school is making AYP) to parents, teachers, principals, schools, and the community so that they can continually refine the instructional program, in an instructionally useful manner, to help all children in Title I, Part A programs meet the challenging State student academic achievement standards.  In addition, an LEA must review and publicize the effectiveness of the actions and activities its schools are carrying out in Title I, Part A programs with respect to parental involvement, professional development, and other activities assisted under Title I, Part A. [Section 1116(a(1)(D),ESEA.]C-21.	What is an LEA responsible for communicating to parents of the children of a school identified for school improvement, for corrective action, or for restructuring?If an LEA identifies a school for improvement, for corrective action, or for restructuring, the LEA must, promptly following identification, provide a notice to a parent or parents of each student enrolled in the school, in a manner consistent with A-8 and A-9, that—• explains what the identification means, and how the school compares academically to other schools served by the LEA and the SEA involved;• identifies the reasons for the identification;• provides an explanation of how the parents can become involved in addressing the academic issues that caused the school to be identified for school improvement; and• explains the parent’s option to transfer his or her child to another public school, with transportation provided by the LEA, or to obtain supplemental educational services for the child. [Section 1116(b)(6), ESEA.]The notification must provide parents with enough relevant information to help them decide what is best for their child.  The LEA—• must inform parents about the academic achievement of students at the school or schools to which their child may transfer;• may choose to include a description of the special academic programs, and facilities, and before- or after-school programs available at those schools;• may include the professional qualifications of teachers in the core academic subjects, and• may identify parental involvement opportunities. [Section 200.37(b), Title I Regulations.]Because an LEA must provide choice to students in eligible schools not later than the first day of the school year, notice to parents should occur well before that date. C-22.	What information about actions taken to address problems that led to a school’s identification for school improvement, for corrective action, or for restructuring must an LEA provide to both parents and the public?In addition to providing school improvement information (see C-21) to the parents of each student in the school, an LEA must publish and disseminate, to both parents and the public, information explaining—• what the school is doing to address the problem of low achievement; • what the LEA or the SEA is doing to help the school address the problem; and• if applicable, a description of specific corrective actions or restructuring plans. [Section 1116(b)(6), ESEA, and Section 200.38, Title I Regulations.]C-23.	What opportunities do the principal and parents of a school have to present evidence if they believe that the elementary or secondary school proposed for identification for improvement, for corrective action, or for restructuring has been identified in error?If the principal or a majority of parents of the students enrolled in the school believe that the school has been proposed for identification for school improvement,  corrective action, or restructuring in error because of statistical or other substantive reasons, the principal may provide supporting evidence to the LEA for consideration prior to a final determination.  The LEA must make a final public determination of the status of the school with respect to identification not later than 30 days after it has provided the school with an opportunity to review the school-level data. [Section 1116(b)(2), ESEA.]C-24.	What responsibility does an LEA have regarding the school improvement plan of an identified school?An LEA must approve the plan, which the school must develop or revise after the school has been identified for improvement.  The school plan must be developed or revised in consultation with parents, school staff, along with the LEA serving the school, and outside experts not later than 3 months after the school is identified and must cover a 2-year period. [Section 1116(b)(3), ESEA.]C-25.	What responsibility does an LEA have for providing technical assistance related to parental involvement to a school identified for school improvement?An LEA is responsible for ensuring that technical assistance is provided during the entire two-year period to each school identified for school improvement as the school develops and implements its improvement, and that the technical assistance is based on scientifically-based research (SBR).  The LEA must provide specific technical assistance that includes help with analyzing data from the assessments, and other examples of student work, to identify and address problems in instruction, and problems, if any, in implementing the parental involvement requirements in section 1118 and the professional development requirements in section 1119. [Section 1116(b)(4), ESEA.]C-26.	What responsibilities to parents does an LEA have with respect to supplemental educational services?	If a Title I school is identified for improvement, or corrective action, or for restructuring, the LEA serving that school must arrange to provide supplemental educational services to eligible children in the school.  The provider of supplemental educational services must have a demonstrated record of effectiveness, and be selected by the child’s parent from a list of providers as retained by the SEA in accordance with reasonable criteria that the SEA has adopted.  An LEA must:• provide, at a minimum, annual notice to parents (in an understandable and uniform format, including alternative formats upon request, and, to the extent practicable, in a language the parents can understand) of: (1) the availability of the supplemental educational services; (2) the identity of the approved providers that are within the LEA or whose services are reasonably available in neighboring LEAs; and (3) a brief description of the services, qualifications, and demonstrated effectiveness of each provider;• if requested, assist parents in choosing a provider from the  list;• apply fair and equitable procedures for selecting students to be served if the number of spaces at approved providers is not sufficient;• not disclose to the public the identity of any student who is eligible for, or receiving, supplemental educational services without the written permission of the parents of the student.  [Section 1116(e)(2), ESEA.] [For additional information see the Supplemental Educational Services Non-Regulatory Guidance at:  http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/suppsvcsguid.pdf]C-27.	What responsibilities does an LEA have to parents of the children in a school that is in the restructuring phase of school improvement?If an LEA identifies a school for restructuring, which means a major reorganization of the school’s governance arrangement, the LEA must provide both parents and teachers with—• Prompt notice; • An opportunity to comment before any action under the restructuring plan takes place; and• An opportunity to participate in the development of any restructuring plans. [Section 1116(b)(8)(C, ESEA); Section 200.43, Title I Regulations.]D.	SCHOOL RESPONSIBILITIESSchool-level Parental Involvement Policies and Funding D-1.	What written parental involvement policies must Title I, Part A schools develop?  Each school must develop, jointly with parents of children participating in Title I, Part A services, a written school parental involvement policy that describes how the school will carry out the parental involvement requirements in section 1118(c) – (f), including the development of a school-parent compact.  If the school already has a parental involvement policy that applies to all parents, the school may amend that existing policy, if necessary, to meet the requirements of section 1118(b).  Schools must update these policies periodically to meet the changing needs of parents and the school. [See Appendix D for a sample template of a District-Wide Parental Involvement Policy.] [Section 1118(b), ESEA.] D-2.	What notification and dissemination requirements apply for school parental involvement policies?  Each school served under Title I, Part A must notify parents of its written parental involvement policy in an understandable and uniform format, including alternative formats upon request, and, to the extent practicable, provide notice and the policy in a language the parents can understand.  In addition, each school must make its written parental involvement policy available to the local community. [For further information on required notices, see Appendix B and see A-8, A-9 and A-10 for additional information about language requirements and alternative formats.] [Section 1118(b)(1),ESEA.] D-3.	What information do the parents’ “right-to-know” provisions require schools to provide parents about the qualifications of teachers of their children who are not highly qualified?Title I, Part A schools must give each parent timely notice when their child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks, by a teacher who is not highly qualified.  [Section 1111(h)(6)(B)(ii), ESEA.] The term “highly qualified” for this purpose is defined in section 200.56 of the Title I regulations (67 Fed. Reg. 71730, December 2, 2002), available at: http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2002-4/120202a.html.] D-4.	How must schools involve parents to improve Title I, Part A programs?  Schools served under Title I, Part A must involve parents, in an organized, ongoing, and timely way, in the planning, review, and improvement of Title I, Part A programs, including—• The planning, review, and improvement of the school parental involvement policy; and • The joint development of any schoolwide program plan under section 1114(b)(2).  [Section 1118(c)(3), ESEA.] If a school already has in place a process for involving parents in the joint planning and design of the school’s programs, the school may use that process so long as it includes an adequate representation of parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs.  [Section 1118(c)(3), ESEA.] D-5.	What meetings must schools hold to inform parents about Title I, Part A programs and parental involvement?  Each school served under Title I, Part A must convene an annual meeting, at a time convenient for parents to inform them of their school’s participation in Title I, Part A programs, and to explain the Title I, Part A requirements and the right of parents to be involved in those programs.  In order to keep parents informed, schools must invite to this meeting all parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs and encourage them to attend.  Schools must offer a flexible number of additional parental involvement meetings, such as in the morning or evening so that as many parents as possible are able to attend.  [Section 1118(c)(1) and (2), ESEA.]D-6.	What information and opportunities must schools provide parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs?  Schools served under Title I, Part A must provide to parents of participating children, in a timely manner, information about the programs funded by Title I, Part A.  That information must include—• A description and explanation of the school’s curriculum;• Information on the forms of academic assessment used to measure student progress; and• Information on the proficiency levels students are expected to meet.Upon the request of parents, schools must provide—• Opportunities for regular meetings for parents to formulate suggestions and to participate, as appropriate, in decisions about the education of their children. The school must respond to any such suggestions as soon as practicably possible. [Section 1118(c)(4), ESEA.]D-7.	Which parents are eligible to participate in parent involvement activities in a schoolwide program school?The purpose of a schoolwide program is to improve academic achievement throughout a high-poverty school (one in which at least 40% of the students are from low-income families) so that all students, but particularly the lowest-achieving students, demonstrate proficiency related to the State’s academic standards. [Section 200.25(a), Title I Regulations.]  In other words, a schoolwide program is an alternative to a targeted assistance program under Title I to raise the achievement of the lowest-achieving students.  Parent involvement is very important in a schoolwide program.  In fact, one of the components of a schoolwide program requires the school to employ strategies to increase parental involvement.  [Section 1114(b)(1)(F), ESEA.]   Consistent with the purpose stated above, all parents in a schoolwide program school are eligible to participate in parent involvement activities.  However, given that the focus of a schoolwide program is to raise the achievement of the lowest-achieving students, a schoolwide program school should ensure that its parent involvement activities include the parents of the lowest-achieving students in order that they may better assist in the education of their child.Shared Responsibility for High Student Academic Achievement D-8.	What is a "school-parent"compact?  Each Title I, Part A school must jointly develop, with the parents of children served under Title I, Part A, a school-parent compact as a component of its written parental involvement policy.  A school-parent compact is a written agreement between the school and the parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs that identifies the activities that the parents, the entire school staff, and the students will undertake to share the responsibility for improved student academic achievement.  In addition, the school-parent compact outlines the activities that the parents, school staff, and students will undertake to build and develop a partnership to help the children achieve to the State’s high academic standards. [Section 1118(d)], ESEA.] [See Appendix E for a sample template of a school-parent compact.] D-9.	What must a “school-parent” compact include?  The school-parent compact must describe—1. The school’s responsibility to provide high-quality curriculum and instruction in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables children served under Title I, Part A to meet the State’s student academic achievement standards;2. Ways in which parents will be responsible for supporting their children’s learning (for example, monitoring attendance, homework completion, or television watching; volunteering in their child’s classroom; and participating as appropriate in decisions relating to the education of their children and positive use of extracurricular time); and3. The importance of communication between teachers and parents on an ongoing basis through, at a minimum—• Parent-teacher conferences in elementary schools, at least annually, during which the compact will be discussed as it relates to the individual child’s achievement;• Frequent reports to parents on their child’s progress; and• Reasonable access to staff, opportunities to volunteer and participate in their child’s class, and observation of classroom activities.   [Section 1118(d), ESEA.] [See Appendix E for a sample template of a school-parent compact.]D-10.	What information must a school provide to parents about their child’s level of achievement on the State academic assessment?Each year a school that receives Title I, Part A funds must provide parents with an individual student report informing them on their child’s level of achievement on the State’s assessments in at least reading/language arts, and math.  [Section 1111(h)(6)(B)(i), ESEA.]  This report may be covered by the SEA reports on individual student academic assessments described in B-6.Schools in Improvement, Corrective Action, or RestructuringD-11.	Must an LEA pay for or provide transportation to service providers?No.  An LEA may provide transportation to service providers, but is not required to do so under the law.  In addition, the costs of such transportation may  not be used to satisfy the 5 percent minimum expenditure requirement for supplemental educational services.  Also, the costs of transportation may not be counted toward satisfying an LEA’s obligation to spend up to an amount equal to 20 percent of its Title I, Part A allocation on choice-related transportation and supplemental educational services.

LEA AND SCHOOL RESPONSIBILITIES TO BUILD PARENT CAPACITYBasic RequirementE-1.	How do LEAs and schools build parents’ capacity for involvement?  Each school and LEA receiving assistance under Title I, Part A must ensure effective involvement of parents and support a partnership among the school, the parents, and the community to improve student academic achievement through training, information, and coordination activities. [Section 1118(e), ESEA.]Providing Assistance and TrainingE-2.	On what topics must schools and LEAs provide parents with assistance and training?  It is the responsibility of schools and LEAs to help parents understand topics that will help them become equal partners with educators in improving their children’s academic achievement.  Schools and LEAs must help parents understand such things as—• The State’s academic content standards and State student academic achievement standards;• State and local academic assessments, including alternative assessments;• The parental involvement requirements of section 1118; and• How to monitor their child’s progress and work with educators to improve the achievement of their child.  [Section 1118(e)(1), ESEA.]E-3.	Does the LEA, with the assistance of its SEA, have a responsibility to upgrade the educational levels of parents of participating students, particularly those parents who do not possess a secondary school diploma?SEAs must encourage an LEA and its schools receiving Title I, Part A funds to offer family literacy services (using Title I, Part A funds) if the LEA or school determines that a substantial number of Title I, Part A students have parents who do not have a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent or who have low levels of literacy. [Section 1111(c)(14), ESEA.]   Title I, Part A funds can be used to support the full range of family literacy activities, including parenting education and educational services for adults who need improved literacy skills in order to support their children’s learning, if the LEA has exhausted all other reasonably available sources of funding for those activities. [Section 1118(e)(7), ESEA.]E-4.	What assistance do schools and LEAs provide to help parents work with their children?  Schools and LEAs must provide materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their children’s achievement such as literacy training for parents, if necessary, and using technology to foster parental involvement.  Other examples of activities that might be provided include:  • literacy programs that bond families around reading and using the public library;• providing information about the essential components of reading instruction to enable parents to support the instructional practices used by the teacher; • training parents in the use of the Internet to enable them to access their children’s homework; communicate with teachers; and review information posted about schools in improvement, supplemental educational services, public school choice and other opportunities to  promote student achievement.  [Section 1118(e)(2), ESEA.]E-5.	Is volunteering in a child’s classroom an activity in which parents can engage to help share the responsibility for student learning?  Yes.  Volunteering and observing in their child’s classroom is an important activity for parents’ shared responsibility for high student academic achievement and is also one that helps both the school and parents build and develop a partnership to help children achieve the State’s high standards. [Section 1118(d)(1), ESEA.] E-6.	What school staff training must schools and LEAs provide related to parental involvement?  Schools and LEAs must educate their staffs in how to work with parents as equal partners.  Specifically, with the assistance of parents, schools and LEAs must educate teachers, pupil services personnel, principals, and other staff in the value and utility of the contributions of parents, and in how to reach out to, communicate with, and work with parents, implement and coordinate parent programs, and build ties between parents and the school.  Schools and LEAs may involve parents in developing this training, in order to improve its effectiveness.  [Section 1118(e)(3) and (6), ESEA.]   Activities to Strengthen Parental InvolvementE-7.	How can schools and LEAs maximize parental involvement and participation in school meetings, conferences, and activities?  Schools may pay reasonable and necessary expenses associated with local parental involvement activities, including transportation and childcare costs, to enable parents to participate in school-related meetings and training sessions.  Schools and LEAs should also arrange school meetings at a variety of times.  In addition, for parents who are unable to attend conferences at school, schools may arrange for and conduct in-home conferences between teachers or other educators who work directly with participating children and the children’s parents.  Schools also may provide training to parents in how to enhance the involvement of other parents.  [Section 1118(e)(8), (9), and (10), ESEA.]  E-8.	May Title I, Part A funds be used to support parents’ attendance at workshops and conferences?The Department strongly encourages parents to attend local or regionally based training opportunities, such as workshops or conferences, when they are the same or similar as those being held out-of-State.  Upon return from any workshop or conference that is not available to all other interested parents, attendees should provide information and, if possible, training on the conference topics to other parents of children enrolled in Title I, Part A programs.  Title I, Part A funds may be used for costs that are reasonable and necessary to support the attendance of parents of participating children at these workshops and conferences to enable them to participate more effectively in the local program or to conduct home-based educational activities.  Paying travel and other costs associated with attendance at out-of-State conferences and workshops may be allowable in some special cases.  E-9.	May a school or all schools within a district use their share(s) of the one percent reservation for parental involvement under section 1118(a)(3)(C) to support a district-level parent resource center or some other district-level activity for parents?The law is clear that 95 percent of the one percent of Title I, Part A allocation the LEA reserves for parental involvement under section 1118 must be distributed among the district’s schools, and that the parents of those schools must be involved both in deciding how those funds will be allotted and, once allotted, how they will be spent.  Parents of children receiving Title I, Part A services and school officials may decide at the school level to pool their individual resources to pay for district-level parental involvement activities, such as a parent resource center.   Coordination with Other Programs and Community InvolvementE-10.	How should schools and LEAs coordinate and conduct parental involvement activities?To the extent feasible and appropriate, schools and LEAs must coordinate and integrate parental involvement programs and activities with the following programs:• Head Start• Reading First• Early Reading First• Even Start Family Literacy Programs• Home Instruction Programs for Preschool Youngsters• Parents as Teachers • Public preschools• Other relevant programs such as Title III language instructional programs. [Sections 1112(b) (1), and (E), 1118(a)(D), ESEA.]In addition, to the extent feasible, schools and LEAs must conduct other activities, such as forming parent resource centers, that encourage and support parents in becoming more involved in their children’s education.  [Section 1118(e)(4), ESEA.] E-11.	How can schools and LEAs involve the community to help ensure the effective involvement of parents?  The Department encourages schools and LEAs to develop appropriate roles for community-based organizations, including faith-based organizations, and businesses in parental involvement activities. These organizations should form partnerships among the school involved, the parents, and the community to improve student academic achievement.  [Section 1118(e)(13), ESEA.]

(2003) Diversity and School, Family, and Community Connections.  Austin, Texas. This synthesis reviews research findings from 64 studies that address some aspect of diversity as it relates to student achievement and school, family, and community connections.  It describes the procedures used to select the studies and a brief overview of the broad concepts related to diversity and family involvement that the studies address. The author lists the studies and publication date, categorizing them according to the research method used, populations addressed, and educational level addressed.  A brief description is provided of the principal limitations of the studies.  The primary audience is practitioner leaders — superintendents, principals, curriculum supervisors, lead teachers, family involvement staff, community leaders, and others who may be responsible for or interested in helping to shape local policy or practice regarding school, family, and community connections. The report is organized so that, depending on their needs and interests, local leaders may quickly access practical information, or may explore the topic in depth.*Henderson, Anne, T., and Mapp, Karen, L. (2002) A New Wave Of Evidence:  The Impact Of School, Family And Community Connections On Student Achievement.  Austin, Texas: National Center for Family and Community Connections with Schools.This review examines the growing evidence that family and community connections with schools make a difference in student success.  The authors look at 51 recent studies - all but two published between 1995 and 2002, covering a range of perspectives and approaches. The studies, some of which are based on scientific research, fall in three broad categories: 1) studies on the impact of family and community involvement on student achievement; 2) studies on effective strategies to connect schools, families, and communities; and 3) studies on parent and community organizing efforts to improve schools.  Mattingley, D.J, Prislin, R., McKenzie, T.L., Rodriquez, J.L., and Kayzar, B. (2002) Evaluating Evaluations:  The Case Of Parental involvement Programs.  Review of Educational Research, 72(4), 549-576.The authors analyzed 41 studies that evaluated K-12 parental involvement programs in order to assess claims that such programs are an effective means of improving student learning.  The authors found that the majority of existing evidence regarding the links between parental involvement and student achievement comes from correlation studies rather than rigorous, systematic evaluations of the impact programs have on student learning (p.550).  Of the 41 studies, the authors found only four that used the most rigorous research design.  Two of these studies found significantly improved performance on standardized achievement tests among children whose parents participated in the intervention program; two found no significant effects.  All four of the studies addressed minority and/or low-income populations.  Each focused on training parents or older siblings to help tutor students or to help with homework.  The two programs also extended the duration of parent training over a longer period than the two showing no significant effect.  The authors also noted that the majority of intervention programs they reviewed focused on changing parent behavior – especially in the areas of parenting and supporting home learning – rather than on changing teacher practices or school structures.Program Evaluation *Starkey, P. and Klein, A. (2000) Fostering Parental Support For Children’s Mathematical Development: An Intervention With Head Start Families.  Early Education and Development, 11( 5), 659-680.This article describes two experimental studies of a four-month program that engaged about 30 families to develop math skills in Head Start children, ages 4-5 years.  Another 30 families were assigned to control groups.  At two sites in the San Francisco area, one serving African American families and the other Latino families, staff gave classes for mothers and children and loaned math activity kits for use at home.  The program supported math knowledge, not literacy.  Control group families did not attend classes or have access to the library.  In both programs, the researchers found that parents were willing and able to work with their children on math when given training and materials.  The children in the program developed greater math knowledge and skills than the control group children.  The authors believe that the two key factors in the programs’ success were the work of parent liaisons and the provision of math kits to families to use at home.Family Involvement At Home To Support Student AchievementArmbruster, B., Lehr, F., Osborn, J.B.

(1998) Effect Of Title I Parental involvement On Student Reading And Mathematics Achievement.  Journal of Research and Development in Education, 31(2), 90-97.This quasi-experimental study examines the effects of parental involvement on the reading and math achievement of 335 Title I students in second through eighth grades, and their parents. The students who participated in the study all were receiving remedial help in reading and math.  Information about their achievement levels was based on pre- and post-tests on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS/4) in reading and math. The district developed a series of three-hour parent workshops that involved information, training, and discussions. Each Title I teacher was required to attend at least four of these sessions during the school year to promote five types of involvement - 1) parenting; 2) parent-teacher communication; 3) parental involvement at school; 4) parental involvement at home; and 5) program decision-making.  The researchers found that students whose parents regularly attended school-based parent workshops made greater gains in reading and math than students with less-involved parents.*Voorhis, V. and Frances, L. (2001) Interactive Science Homework:  An Experiment In Home And School Connections. National Association of Secondary School Principals, Bulletin, 85(627), 20-32.This article describes the results of a study on involving families in the homework of their children using Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork (TIPS), an interactive homework process.  This study compared the effects of TIPS homework with homework that has the same content, but is not interactive.  Three sixth grade classes and two eighth grade classes, totaling 253 students in all, participated for 18 weeks. The participants received weekly homework assignments with learning goals. Only families with TIPS homework were told about how students would involve them in their work.   TIPS students earned significantly higher grades than students who did not use interactive homework.  *Reynolds, A. J. (2001) Success in Early Intervention: The Chicago Child-Parent Centers. Lincoln, Nebraska:  University of Nebraska Press.In this monograph, the author investigates the long-term effects of the Child-Parent Center Program (CPC), a large-scale early childhood intervention program for economically disadvantaged children.  The program operates about 24 centers through the Chicago public schools to children ages 3 to 9 and their families. The central operating principle of the program is that direct parental involvement is expected to enhance parent-child interactions, parent and child attachment to school, and social support among parents, and consequently to promote children’s school readiness and social adjustment.  Programs for parents include a parent resource room in each center and a parent resource teacher who [oversaw] parent activities both within the center and with the community.  Among other topics, this study investigates family outcomes of program participation as secondary to child outcomes.  Snow, C.E., Burns, S.M., & Griffin, P. (Eds.). (1998).

It examines research findings to provide an “integrated picture of how reading develops and how reading instruction should proceed (p.vi).”  Of particular note is chapter 5 as it includes a review of scientific research on parental and family influences on children’s development of language and early reading skills.  The text also includes a discussion of the research on the importance of parents reading to their children and presents research-based strategies for parents to use to gain maximum benefit from parent-child book reading. Reaching and Involving Diverse Parents*Chrispeel, J.H. and Rivero, E. (2001) Engaging Latino Families For Student Success:  How Parent Education Can Reshape Parent’s Sense Of Place In The Education Of Their Children. Peabody Journal of Education, 76(2), 119-169.This study offers some areas for consideration by school staff wishing to initiate parental involvement strategies to engage Latino families. It also provides anecdotes that highlight some of the barriers to parental involvement.  The study examined the effect of a program intervention called the Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE) on 198 immigrant parents’ sense of place in their children’s education.  The most prevalent changes for participants were the increased number of literacy activities, such as reading more and going to the library more frequently, and the discovery that they could initiate contact with the school and not have to wait for the teacher to extend a hand.  The authors conclude that concepts about the parents’ roles, based on cultural traditions and prior experiences that limit the types and levels of involvement can affect how parents interpret a school’s invitations and opportunities to participate.  They also demonstrate, however, that these roles are not fixed and may be altered by information provided by a cultural-broker initiative such as the PIQE. *Desimone, L., Finn-Stevenson, M., and Henrich, C. (2000) Whole School Reform In A Low-Income African American Community: The Effects Of The CoZi Model On Teachers, Parents, And Students. Urban Education, 35(3), 269-323.  The purpose of this quasi-experimental evaluation is to measure the effects of the CoZi model of school reform in a school serving primarily African American, low-income students. The CoZi model seeks to address the needs of preschool and kindergarten children and their families by providing social services through the school and a system for reorganizing school decision-making and service provision to develop a cohesive community of parents, teachers, and students. There were significantly higher parent and community participation rates in the CoZi school than in a comparison school with similar staff and student demographics. The CoZi school also reported more positive attitudes toward parental involvement and more programs to bring parents into the school. In addition, the CoZi school also had a significantly better school climate, especially as reported by teachers. This evaluation gives a comprehensive analysis of a specific school reform approach that emphasizes parental involvement and the impact that it had on school climate and culture, parent and teacher satisfaction, and student achievement.*For more information and inquiries about these studies, contact the National Center for Family & Community Connections with Schools, Southwest Educational Development Laboratory; 211 East Seventh Street (Second Floor); Austin, Texas 78701-3281; Phone: 800-476-6861; Fax: (512) 476-2286; Web: www.sedl.org/connections/
