The word and letter spacing (and possibly even the kerning) are adjusted to ensure, with the exception of the final line, that the text fits the margins.This line uses the default margins.      This paragraph is indented.  The first line is shifted half an inch from the left margin but subsequent lines are aligned with the margin.This paragraph is indented using a hanging indent.  The first line is aligned with the left margin but subsequent lines are indented three-quarters of an inch.  The example is three lines long so the effect can be seen clearly.These three lines are single spaced.  This is the typical line spacing for Word documents.  However, for long documents, it’s nice to have a little extra leading to help the reader’s eye find the start of the next line.Here is an example of “one and a half” (1.5) line spacing.  This is visually more comfortable than single spacing, but it uses considerably more screen real estate (and paper.)For comparison, here is double spaced text.  This spacing is particularly helpful when the document is likely to be reviewed and annotated.  Double spacing wastes a lot of screen real estate.Sometimes it’s necessary to make fine adjustments to a document’s vertical spacing.  Résumés, for example, often have slightly more text than will fit within the available space.  This paragraph is set to “10 points before” (that is, 10 points of vertical space preceding the paragraph), exactly 20 points between lines, and 30 points after (that is, 30 points following the paragraph). The extra spacing is easy to see if you highlight this paragraph.The character spacing is normal in this line.In this line, the character spacing is stretched.In this line, the character spacing is condensed.In the following text, each word is formatted accordingly.“strikethrough”, “double strikethrough”, “superscript”, “subscript”, “shadow”, “outline”, “emboss”, “engrave”, “SMALL CAPS”, “ALL CAPS”, “hidden” (hidden).Note:  “small caps” and “all caps” were entered as lowercase letters, but the font makes them appear capitalized.  The word “hidden” is actually between the quotes, but it is not visible.Numbered items1. Item number one2. Item number two3. Item number three4. Item number four is a long.  It wraps around to the next line to demonstrate how numbering works for long lines.5.

It wraps around to the next line to demonstrate how bullets work for long lines.• Item number fiveNo indent.Indent increased once.Indent increased twice.Indent decreased once.Indent decreased twice.There is a border around the word “border”.The word “yellow” is highlighted in yellow.The word “green” is highlighted in dark green, but it is hard to read black on dark green, so this time “green” is white text on a dark green background.The word “custom” is text of a custom color (RGB = 236,251,41) highlighted in red.  (Note:  This document originated in Word 2003 which allows custom text colors, but has a fixed list of highlighting colors.  This may change in Word 2007.)The following columns use the default tab stops:Column1	Column2	Column3The following columns use the tab stops at 1.5” and 3”:Column1	Column2	Column3The following columns use the tab stops at 2” and 4”:Column1	Column2	Column3Red Orange Yellow Green Blue VioletThis paragraph uses the default margins.
