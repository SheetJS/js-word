The resulting intermediate PQR123 was not isolated and was subsequently reacted with XYZ789 to form PQR 456. This was isolated by crystallisation and then dissolved in toluene. Hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst resulted in the crude drug substance which was purified by crystallisation from aqueous ethanol.A flow diagram for the synthesis of AB1234 is provided in Figure 1 including starting materials, intermediates, solvents and reagents (including catalysts) for each stage and indicating stereochemical information where appropriate. Where intermediates are not isolated this is indicated by the use of square brackets.Synthetic route for batches used in nonclinical studiesTwo batches of AB1234 (R1234/01/1 and R5678/01/1) have been used in key nonclinical studies.  These batches were manufactured according to the flow diagram provided in Figure 1 but aqueous industrial methylated spirits (IMS) was used as the crystallisation solvent instead of aqueous ethanol.

PART III PHARMACO-TOXICOLOGICAL DATAINTRODUCTIONThis is a randomised, placebo controlled, study in approximately 20 healthy male volunteers.  AB 1234 reduces gastric acid secretion by inhibition of the gastric proton pump in the parietal cell. It is rapidly acting and animal data provides evidence of reversible control of gastric acid secretion with once daily dosing.The batches of compound used in the toxicology studies had a similar impurity profile to those to be used in the proposed clinical trial.PHARMACOLOGYSummaryAB1234 has been shown to be a selective proton pump inhibitor.  The proton pump inhibitory activity has been demonstrated in in vitro functional studies and its acid reducing activity has been confirmed in a number of in vivo animal models.  No significant activity has been demonstrated at 32 other receptor types investigated, with the exception that at high concentrations there was some evidence of t1 and  2-adrenoceptor binding activity.Primary PharmacodynamicsAB1234 was shown to be 10 times more potent than omeprazole in the inhibition of pig H+/K+- ATPase with IC50 values of 2.0 x 10-7M and 2.6 x 10-6M respectively. It showed approximately 5% of the activity of ouabain in inhibiting Na+/K+- ATPase. The IC50 value for the inhibition of stimulated acid secretion in isolated rabbit glands was 1.9 x 10-7M. Reversibility of inhibition was observed in studies with pig gastric glands.The acid secretion effect of single intraduodenal doses of 1,3,10 or 30 mg·kg-1 AB1234 on acid output, pepsin secretion and/or total volume were studied in rats with a ligated pylorus (Shay model) in which endogenous parasympathetic mediators stimulate acid secretion and in rats subjected to exogenous stimulation (subcutaneous injection of histamine). Acid output was inhibited to 10% of control values at the 30mg·kg-1 dose. The inhibition of acid secretion was a dose-dependent effect. No significant effect was seen on pepsin secretion or total volume.In the dog chronic gastric fistula model with acid secretion stimulated by either histamine or pentagastrin, single and repeat daily intraduodenal doses inhibited acid secretion with an ED50 of 0.06 mg·kg-1. In the ‘Shay’ model, no ulcers were seen in animals receiving AB1234 10mg·kg-1.The effects of AB1234 on gastric acid secretion and histamine metabolism in the gastric mucosa in two strains of rat were examined. Urinary excretion of gastrin and histamine were increased following the administration of AB1234 10mg·kg-1.Secondary Pharmacodynamics[Include brief details, Do not include extensive information on study designs]SAFETY PHARMACOLOGYSummarySafety Pharmacology studies were completed in accordance to the relevant ICH/CPMP Note for Guidance.  At high doses AB1234 produces transient hypotension, tachycardia, and slight increase in respiration following intravenous administration but not following oral dosing.  CNS effects were only seen at near lethal doses.  GI tract effects were those anticipated from the pharmacology of the product.[Tabulated results helpful.

Kinetics would appear to be linear in all species at the doses tested. There were no apparent sex differences in the ADME profile of AB1234.[Avoid discussing species separately and instead discuss absorption, then distribution, metabolism and excretion.  If data generated as part of toxicology study (i.e. Toxicokinetic data) include here and not as separate section.]AB1234 was rapidly absorbed following oral dosing (Tmax = 0.3-0.75 h) in all species studies (mouse, rat and dog).  Oral absolute bioavailability was 43% in the mouse and rat and 66% in the dog. The volume of distribution was high in all species, indicating that AB1234 is extensively distributed.  Whole body radiography studies in the rat indicate that the radiolabelled material was rapidly distributed to all organs with very limited CNS penetration.  Organs that showed the highest levels of radiolabelled material were the excretory organs and the adrenals.In vitro studies in isolated hepatocytes from the different species indicate that there are two major metabolites (M1 and M2). There were no apparent qualitative differences between animals and man.  There was evidence of enzyme induction following repeat dosing with doses greater that 150 mg·kg-1·day-1 in rats as evidenced by a smaller AUC value after 14 days treatment at this dose compared to Day 1.  In vitro data to date would indicate that AB1234 is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4.In vivo studies showed evidence of enzyme induction following repeat dosing with doses greater that 150 mg·kg-1·day-1 in rats as evidenced by a smaller AUC value after 14 days treatment at this dose compared to Day 1. Excretion studies would indicate that AB1234 is excreted predominately in the urine of the mouse (90% of dose), but urinary and faecal elimination were equally important in other species.  There was significant enterohepatic circulation of AB1234 in the rat.No pharmacodynamic or kinetic drug interaction studies have been performed.[A table like the following is extremely useful.  Inclusion of anticipated HUMAN plasma concentration believed to be required to produce meaningful clinical effect very helpful.]Summary of kinetic data for AB1234 in animal species following oral administration.SpeciesDose(mg·kg-1·day-1 )Cmax (ng·mL-1)Tmax (hrs)AUC(0-24)(ng.h/ml)T1/2 (h)Mouse1003000.34320.5Rat1075150301454600.50.50.715211002300111.25Dog103090401253500.750.750.752016121750444.2TOXICOLOGYSummaryAll studies were performed in accordance with Good laboratory practice (GLP).

The pharmacokinetics are uncomplicated with the possible exception of enzyme induction at high doses.  This enzyme induction was probably responsible for the hepatocellular hypertrophy and should not be problematic in man.  The only significant finding in the animal studies was a dose-related increase in plasma gastrin levels, which is an anticipated effect seen with proton pump inhibitors.  No other target organ toxicity was observed in rats and dogs respectively. [Include any recommendations for specific monitoring to be used on proposed trials.
